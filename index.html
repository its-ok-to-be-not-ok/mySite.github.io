        <h1>My Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello, I am Hoang Trung Hieu. Welcome to my introduction card. I'm passionate about coding and programming. 
        Currently, I work as a AI developer. Feel free to connect with me!</p>

        <div class="about-me">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hello, I'm Hieu, an AI enthusiast and student. My journey in the world of artificial intelligence is fueled by a 
                passion for creating intelligent systems that can solve complex problems. From exploring machine learning algorithms to diving into natural 
                language processing, my hobbies extend beyond coding â€“ I'm an avid reader of AI research papers and enjoy participating in Kaggle competitions. 
                With a solid background in computer science and a focus on AI, I've honed my skills in developing innovative solutions. I've had the privilege of 
                working on projects that leverage neural networks for image recognition and natural language understanding. Whether it's crafting algorithms or 
                experimenting with the latest AI frameworks, I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of artificial intelligence. 
                Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities at the intersection of technology and AI!
